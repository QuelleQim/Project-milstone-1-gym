                    Honorine is the founder of Stux Crossbox.
                    She started training as a young child at the age of five doing different sports, but eventually at the age of
                    seven she devoted all of her time to gymnastics and ended up competing for many years. At the age of 21 she
                    went to a crossfit box for a free trial and has never stopped since. Now she holds a level 2 certification.
                    Honorine is passionate about training crossfit and wants to spread the message about it so that more people
                    can enjoy a great workout and live a healthier lifestyle. To do this she often host and partake in
                    seminars and lectures about training and psysical health. 

                    She is also considered jack of trades, master of none due to her expansive education experience.
                    While she is a certified level 2 crossfit trainer, she is also a certified nutritionist, gardener and car mechanic.
