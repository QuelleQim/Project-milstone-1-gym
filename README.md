## Deployment

1. How I deployed my project to gitpages.
    1. I logged in to my github account, clicked my 'Stux-Crossbox-project1' repository and clicked 'settings'.
    1. I scrolled down to GitHub Pages and in 'Source' I clicked to option 'master' and then pressed the 'Save' button.
    1. After a couple of hours the project was uploaded to gitpages and responsive.

Since the gitpage is rooted from the repositorys master branch there is no difference between the gitpage and github repository, exept for a minor delay of a few minutes.

To run the project locally one needs to clone the repository and open it in a web browser. Unfortunatly, the google maps in find-us.html might not work due to the API key that needs to be correlated with the web address.
